# Beans_dataset
Date 7/6/2020

First Attempt
1. Somehow when taking from folder number of classes are coming as 4 but in reality we have 3 - angular leaf spot, beans rust and health. Need to identify the 4th class what is that.
2. Accuracy on training is less that validation why?
3. Can we improve the result using the same data set?
